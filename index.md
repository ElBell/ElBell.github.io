  <p>Eleonor Marilyn Bart, affectionately known as Ellie, peacefully departed this world on June 9, 2023, leaving behind a legacy of love, kindness, and strength. She was a beloved daughter, a doting sister, a cherished friend, and a devoted wife whose radiant spirit touched the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing her.</p>
  
  <p>To honor Ellie's memory and the incredible person she was, the family kindly requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to a Memorial Fund that will be established in her honor. This cause will support women from non-traditional paths who are aspiring to become Software Engineers, just like Ellie. To sign up to receive more details on the fund, put your email in the form below.</p>
